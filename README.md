# UNIVERSAL QUESTION INTERFACE
## MAIN QUESTION PATTERN
In this Universal crowd sourcing questionnaire, we will be accepting eight different types of questions, which will be of MCQ type. The eight different types of questions will include:
- Single correct answer type (radio type)
- Multiple correct answer type (checklist type)
- Match the following (radio type)
- Assertion and Reasoning (radio type)
- Numerical questions 
- Fill in the blanks

The anonymous users will enter the questions and the appropriate options (except for in the case of Numerical and Fill in the blanks type questions) and must mention the correct answer from amongst the options as well as the difficulty level.

 These questions will then be loaded into the ‘Questionnaire database’. From the database, the department administrators will review the questions and move the relevant questions to the ‘Verified Questions Database’ either just as it is or with slight changes made by the administrators (either in the question itself, or the options entered by the anonymous users or the difficulty level).
 
  Later these questions will be used by the authorities to randomly generate question papers for the examinations as well as for mock tests. They will be able to choose questions as per the difficulty levels and form the question papers to their liking.

The generated mock papers will be available for the public on the website along with the solutions, whereas the actual question papers will be in control of the admins and can be viewed only with permission from the top authorities.

## QUESTION TYPES
### Single Correct Answer Type
Questions following this pattern will have options in radio form where the student can choose ONLY ONE possible option.
